              The Kynno Foundation will be created with a mission to accelerate decentralized technologies
              adoption to the masses. The vision of a world where individuals are empowered to retain
              ownership of their data and can access networks through which they transfer value
              without being reliant on third-parties. The Kynno Foundation’s initial focus will be
              expanding and developing the ecosystem of the Kynno Network.
